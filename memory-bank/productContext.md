# RAGKA v2 - Product Context

## 1. Why This Project Exists

RAGKA v2 (Retrieval Augmented Generation Knowledge Assistant) exists to provide users with a reliable and intelligent assistant capable of answering questions based on a given knowledge base. The core motivation is to bridge the gap between vast amounts of information and the user's need for concise, accurate, and verifiable answers. It aims to enhance productivity and decision-making by making information more accessible and trustworthy.

## 2. Problems It Solves

This project addresses several key challenges:
- **Information Overload:** Users often face too much information to sift through manually. RAGKA v2 retrieves the most relevant pieces of information.
- **Answer Verifiability:** Standard AI-generated answers can be hard to trace back to their sources. RAGKA v2 aims to provide clear citations for its responses, allowing users to verify the information.
- **Contextual Understanding:** The system is designed to understand user queries in the context of the provided data sources, leading to more relevant answers than generic models.
- **Efficient Knowledge Access:** It provides a conversational interface to complex datasets, making it easier for non-experts to access and understand information.

## 3. How It Should Work

RAGKA v2 operates as a chat-based application:
- **User Interaction:** Users type questions into an input text box. The input supports multi-line text and dynamically adjusts its height for a better user experience.
- **Backend Processing:**
    - The user's query is sent to the backend.
    - The RAG system retrieves relevant documents/chunks from the configured knowledge base (e.g., Azure Search, Elasticsearch).
    - These retrieved sources, along with the user's query, are passed to a large language model (LLM) like Azure OpenAI's GPT models.
- **Response Generation:**
    - The LLM generates an answer based on the query and the provided sources.
    - The system processes this answer to include citations (e.g., `[1]`, `[2]`) that link back to the specific sources used.
- **Frontend Display:**
    - The generated answer is displayed in the chat interface.
    - Cited sources are listed, ideally with links or references, allowing users to explore the original documents.
    - The chat interface maintains a history of the conversation.

## 4. User Experience (UX) Goals

- **Intuitive Interface:** The chat interface should be clean, easy to understand, and familiar to users. The input text box should be responsive and adapt to user input.
- **Trust and Transparency:** Clear citation of sources is paramount. Users should feel confident in the information provided and be able to easily verify it.
- **Responsiveness:** The system should provide answers in a timely manner. UI elements should feel interactive and responsive.
- **Accuracy and Relevance:** Answers should be accurate based on the provided knowledge base and directly relevant to the user's query.
- **Clarity:** Both the answers and the source information should be presented clearly.
- **Accessibility:** The application should be designed with accessibility best practices in mind.
